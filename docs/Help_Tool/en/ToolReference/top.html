		<h1>Tool-Reference</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<h3>Tool</h3>
		<p>
This tool consists of a viewer section that displays the result of editing effects and multiple windows to edit parameters.
By editing the parameters of each window, you can create an effect or change its appearance.
By dragging and dropping each window, you can change the placement or change it to a tab.
By selecting "Menu bar -> Window", you can select windows and display windows that are not arranged in the initial placement.
Also, you can return all windows to initial placement.
		</p>

		<h3>Effect</h3>
		<p>
With this tool, you create an effect by editing a node. Nodes have parent-child relationships, and children are affected by parents.
By using the parent-child relationship, it is possible to generate complicated effects.
        </p>

        <p>
I will explain parent-child relationship using an example. In this example, node 2 exists in the child of node 1, and node 3 exists in the child of node 2.
Effect 1 will be generated from node 1. After a few frames, several effects 2 will be generated relative to effect 1 from the effect generated from node 1. After a few more frames, effect 3 will be generated from the effect generated from node 2. This is shown in the figure below. In this way, by describing the behavior of the effect and the parent-child relationship on the node, various effects can be expressed.
In this tool, one effect generated based on the "node" parameter is called "particle".

		<h3>File format</h3>
		<p>
There are two unique file formats for this tool.
The first one is ".efkproj", which is a file of effects for editing with tools.
The second is ".efk", a file of effects to play during the game.
The ".efk" file can be output from the "menu bar -> file -> output" of the tool.

		<h2>Command line</h2>

<p>
When starting Effekseer from the command line, you can change the behavior of Effekseer by adding arguments.
For example, you can convert ".efkproj" file to ".efk" without activating the Effekseer GUI.
By combining this with a script, you can convert files of effects in any folder at once.
