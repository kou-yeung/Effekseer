		<h1>Basic settings</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>
You can set the parameters that are always used, regardless of the name of the node, the number of generations, and other particle settings.

		<h2>Parameter</h2>
		
		<h3>Visibility</h3>
		<p>
Whether or not particles generated from this node are drawn on the screen. If you check this, particles will be drawn on the screen.
When outputting for games, particles are not drawn unless this is checked.
		</p>

		<h3>Name</h3>
		<p>
Set the name displayed in the node tree. It does not affect the operation of the effect.
Set it for organizing nodes when more nodes become available.
		</p>

		<h3>Spawn Count</h3>
		<p>
Sets the maximum number of particles generated from this node.
You can also choose infinite to generate particles indefinitely until you can not generate particles with the setting of the conditions described later.
However, when playing an effect from another application that incorporates Effekseer,
please note that it will not disappear unless the function is called and the user deletes the effect.
		</p>

		<h3>Inherit Position</h3>
		<p>
Sets how the position of the parent particle affects the particles generated from this node.
Please refer to the following information regarding parameter contents.
		</p>

		<h3>Inherit Rotation</h3>
		<p>
Sets how the rotation of parent particles affects particles generated from this node.
Please refer to the following information regarding parameter contents.
		</p>

		<h3>Inherit Scale</h3>
		<p>
Sets how the enlargement of parent particles affects particles generated from this node.
Please see the following information regarding the contents of parameters.
		</p>

		<h3>Inherit **</h3>

		<h4>Always</h4>
		<p>
It is always affected. When the value of the parent particle is changed, the child particles are also immediately affected.
When the parent particle disappears, the value at the time of disappearance is used without being changed even after it disappears.
		</p>

		<h4>Only on create</h4>
		<p>
Use the value when the child particles were generated.
		</p>

		<h4>Never</h4>
		<p>
It will not be affected. Whatever the value of the parent particle is, the behavior of the particle is determined only by the parameters of the child node.
		</p>

		<h3>Destroy after time</h3>
		<p>
When survival time passes, particles are deleted. If you do not check this, particles will not be deleted after the survival time.
		</p>

		<h3>Destroy with parent</h3>
		<p>
When the parent particle is deleted, it also deletes the child particles.
		</p>

		<h3>Destroy when no more children</h3>
		<p>
If particles of the particle are not present and it is unlikely that children will be generated in the future, delete the particles.
		</p>

		<h3>Time to live</h3>
		<p>
Sets the number of frames in which particles are present. If deletion is not checked due to lifetime, this parameter does not affect particle behavior.
		</p>

		<h3>Spawn Rate</h3>
		<p>
Sets the cycle at which particles are generated. The number of frames specified will be required from generation of particles to generation of the next particle.
You can specify less than 1 for this generation time, and you can generate multiple particles per frame.
		</p>

		<h3>Initial Delay</h3>
		<p>
Specify the time from generation of parent particles to generation of child particles for the first time.
		</p>
