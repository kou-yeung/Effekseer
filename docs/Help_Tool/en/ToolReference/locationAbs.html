		<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Set parameters related to positions that are not affected by the position and angle of the parent particle.
These parameters move the particles after the parent particle and child particle position changes have been applied.

		<h3>Gravity</h3>
		<p>
Apply acceleration in one direction. It can be applied not only to the bottom but also to the top and the right.
		</p>


		<h3>Attraction (if point is set)</h3>
		<p>
The particle moves to the position specified as "Point of Attraction" of "Behavior".

		<h4>Attraction</h4>
<p>
It is a force to accelerate towards the target position in one frame.
</p>

		<h4>Resistance</h4>
<p>
It is the rate of correcting the moving direction to the target direction in one frame. It takes a value between 0.00 and 1.00.
</p>

		<h4>Minimum Range</h4>
<p>
It is the attenuation start distance of attraction.
</p>

		<h4>Maximum Range</h4>
<p>

It is the attenuation end distance of attraction.
When the position of the particle is in the range from 0 to the minimum range, the attraction is 100%.
If it is farther than the maximum range, the attractive force becomes 0%.
If it is between the minimum range and the maximum range, it attenuates linearly.
