		<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This section explains about "drawing common" which sets parameters common to all drawing methods.
</p>

		<h2>パラメーター</h2>
		
		<h3>色/歪み画像</h4>
		<p>
Sets the color image or distortion image to be used for particle display. As the name suggests, the color image is an image in which a pattern or the like that is almost directly displayed is drawn. In most cases, you set color images. Regarding the distorted image, we will explain with the distortion item below.
		</p>

		<h3>ブレンド</h4>
		<p>
Specifies the method of alpha blending applied to particle display. Specify the composition method for already drawn images such as translucency, addition, subtraction.
		</p>

		<h3>フィルタ</h4>
		<p>
Specify the method of filter to be applied to particle display.
		</p>

		<h3>深度書き込み</h3>
		<p>
Specify whether to write depth (depth) information when displaying particles. After writing the depth information, if you draw the particles for which the depth test is enabled, if the particles are deep inside, it will not be drawn.
		</p>

		<h3>深度テスト</h3>
		<p>
If the depth test is valid, particles will not be drawn deeper than the written depth information.
		</p>

		<h3>フェードイン</h3>
		<p>
When particles are displayed, they are faded in so that they are displayed.
		</p>

		<h3>フェードアウト</h3>
		<p>
When a particle disappears, it fades out and disappears.
		</p>

		<h3>UV</h4>
		<p>
In the color / distortion image, specify the range actually used for particle display.
Since the range used is changed with time, you can animate the image.
The unit of the numerical value used to specify the area is pixel.
		</p>

		<h3>歪み</h3>
		<p>
下記の歪みの項目で説明します。

		<h3>歪み強度</h3>

		<h2>歪みについて</h2>

<p>
If the distortion setting is enabled, the particles will distort the background. 
The way of distortion depends on the distorted image, the setting of the color of each drawing, and the distortion intensity.
</p>

<p>
In the color of distortion image, red and green are used as distortion information. Both of them do not distort at all when the value is 127. When red is 127 or more, it is distorted to the right, and when it is less than 127 it distorts to the left.
When green is 127 or more, distortion in the upward direction and distortion in the downward direction when the green is less than 127. However, this up / down / left / right direction depends on the drawing method. For example, in the case of a sprite, the top, bottom, left, and right are determined in the direction of the side of the rectangle.
</p>


<p>
The color of each drawing weakens the strength of distortion. When 255 becomes 0 at the maximum, it will not distort. Red affects left and right, and green affects up and down.
</p>

<p>
Distortion strength adjusts the strength of all strains. When it becomes 0, it will not distort.
